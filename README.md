# User Authentication With Express and Mongo

A custom user authentication application that controls users access to web resources using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. The application lets users sign up, log in, and log out, limiting access to password-protected resources. This application leverages the document based NoSQL database, MongoDB, to store the user data by creating a user model with mongoose.

Express is a popular web framework for creating MVC applications and RESTful APIs in Node.js.  Express lets us define routes and middleware for submitting and retrieving data in our database.

Mongoose is an open source Node package for defining data models for an application and connecting to MongoDB.
